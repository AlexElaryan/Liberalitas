                Service interface when You intent to make a transaction. The amount of the transaction fee will comprise

                Service interface form part of these Terms and Conditions and may be changed at any time by us in
                accordance with these Terms and Conditions.</p>

            <p> 2.2 Your transactions may be subject to currency conversions. If You make a payment from Your eWallet
                denominated in one currency to a third party eWallet or bank account denominated in another currency,
                You
                will be offered the option of making the payment in the currency of Your eWallet or in another currency.

                currency exchange fees shall be borne by You. </p>
            <p> 2.3 For every currency conversion, We will use a source as made known to You plus a foreign exchange
                fee,
                which is displayed in the Service interface. The foreign exchange fee is payable in addition to the

                notifying
                You, but these will be reflected in the information on Your eWallet. Transaction fees will be charged
                when
                the transaction is executed. If Your eWallet balance is insufficient to cover the fees, We may refuse to
                execute the payment. Reversal or chargeback fees will be deducted when incurred. </p>
            <p> 2.5 If the deduction of fees results in a negative eWallet balance, you will be required to repay such
                negative balance by uploading sufficient funds into your eWallet. Failure to do so is a breach of these
                Terms and Conditions. Repayment of the negative balance is due immediately without notice. However, We

                reversed transaction involves third party costs You remain liable for these and they will be deducted
                from
